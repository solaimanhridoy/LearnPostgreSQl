# Learn PostgreSQL 

[TOC]



### Preface

Here we will be introduced with PostgreSQL an open source, robust, high performance database with a lot of great features where we will do some hands on practice to learn the basics of PostgreSQL. All the implementations were tested on Ubuntu 18.04. Before dive into PostgreSQL we will have a look on some basic theory of **database**, **SQL** and **PostgreSQL**. 

#### What is a Database? 

The **database** is an organized collection of structured data which is used to store, manipulate and retrieve data.

#### What is SQL and Relational Database? 

A **relational database** is a type of database that stores access to data points that  are related to one another.

**SQL** (Structured Query Language) is a domain specific language in programming that can manipulate a relational database.

#### What is PostgreSQL?

**PostgreSQL** also known as '**Postgres**' is an open source, robust, high performance object-relational database system that extends the SQL language with a lot of great features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads.
